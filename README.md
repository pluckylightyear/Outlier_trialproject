Will Bellamy - JCDM Trial Project (Part 5)

This is a repository for Part 5 of my Trial Project for the JCDM role at Outlier.

For this creative project I wanted to draft a web page that would help students read and analyze poetry online — a kind of "close reading supplement". It is a work-in-progress, and I look forward to fine-tuning its design and educational value. (To do list at the end.)

Statement: While a poem often takes up little space on the page, there are massive amounts of information "around" a poem——the author, the context, the rhyme scheme, the references, the various translations available to us. As a student, when trying to read and understand poetry in another language, from another era, I often found myself with three or four different books open, switching back and forth between sources. My idea for this project was to start collecting this textual, historical, and visual information in one place, so that students can easily access the original text, the translation, the audio recording, and various other bits of information that would aid them in a close reading. The tool could be used to aid discussion, create ideas for essays and assignments, maybe even spark new translations.

For this first version I chose the opening of "Sir Gawain and The Green Knight," a mysterious and often bizarre poem that survives in just one manuscript from the 14th century; the manuscript was additionally lost and rediscovered only in the 19th century. The poem begins with a grandiose reference to the siege of Troy, only to segway to Sir Gawain chopping off the head of a partially humanlike monster on Christmas. The background (created in Adobe InDesign) takes images from the original manuscript to immerse readers in the historical context, and to remind them that early "books" were lavishly decorated, in lieu of the simple sheets of paper we have today.


One page of the site includes a bilingual view, where students can analyze a translation side-by-side with the original:

A button (bottom left) links to a second page, which is a sole-view of the original text, with additional information on the author, rhyme scheme, plus an audio recording of the Old English.

In short, I wanted to combine my love for poetry and language with new skills I've been learning in web design and web development. I hope you enjoy this draft (see below) and thank you for reading.

TO DO:
<p>-make the site more easily scaleable using bootstrap or similar;</p>
<p>-create footnotes on various lines which would open when hovered over, similar to wikipedia's footnotes;</p>
<p>-program buttons on the center-view page to highlight rhyme scheme (alliterative verse, the "bob and wheel" in the last 5 lines), along with a pop-out for information on the manuscript (right now they're dead buttons)</p>
<p>-create a toggle button that would toggle different translations into Modern English, so students could see different interpretations at ease, instead of just one;</p>
<p>-make the page more interactive with fade-ins and fade-outs, perhaps a subtly undulating background, and create a sliding effect between bilingual view and center view, which lets the translation drop out and the original text seamlessly slide to the center;</p>
<p>-fill out page in general, make it seem less like a juvenile website from 2006;
<p>-reprogram the page to follow best practices (this is one of my first projects with html/css so it's not the cleanest). </p>
