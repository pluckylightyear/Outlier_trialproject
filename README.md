Will Bellamy - JCDM Trial Project (Part 5)

This is a repository for Part 5 of my Trial Project for the JCDM role at Outlier.

For this creative project, I wanted to make a "close reading supplement" for students looking to closely analyze poetry online, especially poetry in translation. This is simply a draft, and there are many elements that I still would like to add (see To Do List at the end!).

My Artist's Statement would be as follows: While a poem arguably requires the least amount of ink, there are massive amounts of information "around" a poem——the context, the rhyme scheme, the references, the various translations available to us. As a student, when close reading a passage of poetry, I often found myself with three or four different books open, switching back and forth between sources. My idea for this project was to gather all that information in one place, so that students can easily access the original text, the translation, the audio recording, and various other bits of information that would aid them in a close reading. This kind of tool could be used to assign work on a specific passage, or aid students in writing essays on a specific passage.

I chose the opening of "Sir Gawain and The Green Knight," a mysterious and often bizarre poem that survives in just one manuscript from the 14th century; the manuscript was additionally lost and only rediscovered in the 19th century. The background I created in InDesign takes images from the original manuscript to immerse readers in the historical context, and to remind them that early "books" were lavishly decorated, in lieu of the simple white pieces of paper we have today.

One page of the site includes a bilingual view, where students can analyze a translation side-by-side with the original:

A button at the bottom of the original links to a second page, which is a sole-view of the original text, with additional information on the author, rhyme scheme, and an audio recording of how the Old English sounds:

In short, I wanted to combine my love for poetry and language with new skills I've been learning in programming and web development. This is simply a draft, and there is still plenty that I'd like to do. See below!

TO DO:
<p>-make the site more easily scaleable using bootstrap or similar;</p>
<p>-create footnotes on various lines which would open when hovered over, similar to wikipedia's footnotes;</p>
<p>-program buttons on the center-view page to highlight rhyme scheme (alliterative verse, the "bob and wheel" in the last 5 lines), along with a pop-out for information on the manuscript (right now they're dead buttons)</p>
<p>-create a toggle button that would toggle different translations into Modern English, so students could see different interpretations at ease, instead of just one;</p>
<p>-make the page more interactive with fade-ins and fade-outs, perhaps a subtly undulating background, and create a sliding effect between bilingual view and center view, which lets the translation drop out and the original text seamlessly slide to the center;</p>
<p>-fill out page in general, make it seem less like a juvenile website from 2006 
<p>-reprogram the page to follow best practices (this is one of my first projects with html/css so it's not the cleanest). </p>
