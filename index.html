                        Since the siege and the assault upon Troy were finished, <br>
                        The city destroyed and burned down to embers and ashes, <br>
                        And the man who made the decoys that deceived them <br>
                        Was tried for his treachery, though no man on earth was more true, <br>
                        It was the noble Aeneas and his high-born kin <br>
                        Who came to conquer provinces and become the lords <br>
                        Of almost all the wealth of the Western Isles. <br>
                        Noble Romulus went to Rome at once. <br>
                        Proudly he set up that city at the beginning, <br>
                        Giving it his own name, which it bears to this day. <br>
                        Ticius to Tuscany, to begin building there. <br>
                        Longobard builds high houses in Lombardy, <br>
                        And far across the flood from France Felix Brutus <br>
                        Is happy to settle the many hills and the whole breadth <br>
